## Code Challenge

### Introduction
You have been given a gift card that is about to expire and you want to buy gifts for 2 friends. You want to
spend the whole gift card, or if that’s not an option as close to the balance as possible. You have a list of sorted
prices for a popular store that you know they both like to shop at. Your challenge is to find two distinct items in
the list whose sum is minimally under (or equal to) the gift card balance.
The file contains two columns:
1. A unique identifier of the item. You can assume there are no duplicates.
2. The value of that item in cents. It is always a positive integer that represents the price in cents (1000
= $10.00).

### Write a program to find the best two items. It takes two inputs:
1. A filename with a list of sorted prices
2. The balance of your gift card
If no two items have a sum that is less than or equal to the balance on the gift card, print “Not possible”. You
don’t have to return every possible pair that is under the balance, just one such pair
